There are many reasons why you'd want to become better at programming. The industry is highly competitive. Improving your skills sets you apart from the masses. You ensure your skills remain relevant which can provide job security. Treating programming as a craft allows you to take pride in your work. You may find deep satisfaction in mastering your craft. The sense of accomplishment from building software can be fulfilling. In summary, it benefits your career allowing you to make a meaningful contribution to the field. It is a path to professional growth, personal satisfaction, and long-term success.

So, if you're eager to turn your job into a craft and elevate your coding skills, let's delve into the advice of those seasoned professionals who were kind enough to share their guidance and help us with our struggles.

- Try to  be a good person. Be someone people can trust and rely on.
- Don't jump in the deep end, at first. Make sure that you thoroughly understand the basics. Start by doing little things. Don't set your expectations too high at the start. Try not to make life hard for yourself.
- Don't skip fundamentals. Learn about data types and structures, algorithms, programming paradigms, and all important basics.
- Keep it fun. If it becomes a chore, it's probably going to discourage you from doing it.
- Practice, practice, practice.
- Avoid tutorial trap. Don't get stuck for too long on tutorials. You may start with a tutorial but try to improvise and continue implementing your own idea as soon as possible.
- Don't worry about memorizing things. The important thing is just to know where to find the information you need. You'll probably google things every day.
- It will get easier over time.
- Patience. To become a goog programmer you need time, patience, focus, and good attitude. This process is more likely to be a marathon, not a sprint.
- Never compare yourself to someone else. Compare yourself today to who you were yesterday. Just try to get better every day.
- Programming is hard. When you start your first job, you feel pressured to go faster all the time. Try to slow down. Take a bit of time to understand how everything works, to just learn and mature.
- Chase the work you find interesting. And if you're passionate about something you'll get great at it. And when you're great at something, success and monetary rewards will follow.
- If you're unwilling to learn and change, you become irrelevant.
- Interviewing is a skill in of itself and it takes practice to master.
- Clear communication is an essential requirement in interviews. Interviewers want to know that you can hear what they say, conceptualize it, turn it into a step-by-step answer, and turn it into a code that they can understand.
- Experience is what people hire for. Earn it. Be the developer that you'd want to work with. Have that passion and desire burning inside you.
- Keep discovering things you like to do. Be passionate, be curious.
- Be a developer that everyone wants to hire - the developer that is curious.
- Your successful career is a sum of small decisions over time.
- Don't be overconfident in your skills.
- When looking for a job, networking is huge. Most of the jobs come from you knowing somebody else. Know people, be able to interact with people.
- Don't give up. Don't make excuses.
- Struggling is fine. The big thing is to recover from struggling.
- Contribute to Open Source, FOSS. Create content, educate others through blog posts, tutorials, courses. Contribute to the community, build your personal brand. Content creation can lead to professional opportunities and help establish your expertise in the industry. Go outside of your comfort zone, share your knowledge.
- Try building a course. This will help you to learn an enormous amount of things on a topic you already know (The Feynman Technique). You'll be able to see how much you really know versus how much you assumed you know.
- Don't avoid professional development opportunities: hackatons, etc. Take part in anything that could potentially enhance your sills, knowledge, or brand image.
