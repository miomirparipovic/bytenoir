Everywhere you look nowadays, there's a device running code: your computer, phone, smartwatch, car, and even your fridge. Coding, also known as computer programming, is a way of creating instructions for these devices, bringing them to life.

But those electronic tools are not like you and me. They don't communicate like humans. They can't guess our mood, read our feelings, or infer our thoughts and intentions. They only understand precise, step-by-step instructions, and they follow those instructions to a fault.

Contrary to the popular belief, computers (used in this text as a representative for all electronic devices) are not really that smart. They can perform a limited set of basic operations-adding ones and zeroes, shifting bits left and right, inverting bits, storing them into memory, etc. What makes them extraordinary is their speed and ability to combine these basic operations into something far more complex. Still, because they strictly follow our instructions, they also faithfully mirror the programmer's knowledge-or his or her shortcomings.

There are many reasons why you'd want to become better at programming. The industry is highly competitive. Improving your skills sets you apart from the masses. You ensure your skills remain relevant which can provide job security. Treating programming as a craft allows you to take pride in your work. You may find deep satisfaction in mastering your craft. The sense of accomplishment from building software can be fulfilling. In summary, it benefits your career allowing you to make a meaningful contribution to the field. It is a path to professional growth, personal satisfaction, and long-term success.

So, if you're eager to turn your job into a craft and elevate your coding skills, let's delve into the advice of those seasoned professionals who were kind enough to share their guidance and help us with our struggles.

- Try to be a good person. Be someone people can trust and rely on.
- Don't jump in the deep end, at first. Make sure that you thoroughly understand the basics. Start by doing little things. Don't set your expectations too high at the start. Try not to make life hard for yourself.
- Don't skip fundamentals. Learn about data types and structures, algorithms, programming paradigms, and all important basics.
- Keep it fun. If it becomes a chore, it's probably going to discourage you from doing it.
- Practice, practice, practice.
- Avoid tutorial trap. Don't get stuck for too long on tutorials. You may start with a tutorial but try to improvise and continue implementing your own idea as soon as possible.
- Don't worry about memorizing things. The important thing is just to know where to find the information you need. You'll probably google things every day.
- It will get easier over time.
- Patience. To become a goog programmer you need time, patience, focus, and good attitude. This process is more likely to be a marathon, not a sprint.
- Never compare yourself to someone else. Compare yourself today to who you were yesterday. Just try to get better every day.
- Programming is hard. When you start your first job, you feel pressured to go faster all the time. Try to slow down. Take a bit of time to understand how everything works, to just learn and mature.
