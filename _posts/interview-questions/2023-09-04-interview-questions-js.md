### What is JS?

JS is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the WWW, alongside HTML and CSS. It is a high-level, JIT compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. 

JS has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has many APIs available for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). 

The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JS APIs for I/O.

JS is a single-threaded language, which means it can run one line at a time, sequentially. JS can also be non-blocking and behave as if it were multi-threaded thanks to the help of asynchronous operations and browser's multi-threading capabilities, event loop, Web APIs, web workers, etc.


### What is ECMAScript?

ECMAScript, often abbreviated as ES, is a standard for a scripting language or a scripting language specification. JS is one of the well-known implementations of this standard.

ES defines the syntax and semantics, and provides guidelines for how these scripting languages should function.

ES is maintained by the ECMA International standards organization (**European Computer Manufacturer's Association**), specifically under the *Ecma Technical Committee 39* (TC39).

So, in summary, the purpose of ES is:

- Defines language features.
- Ensures compatibility across different browsers and runtime environments.
- Standardizes APIs (defines standard APIs for common tasks, such as manipulating the DOM), etc.
