### Objects
`Date: 07/01/2024`

The most basic data types in JavaScript are called 'primitives'. We call them 'primitives' because they contain a single thing of something (bool, number, string, etc.)

Objects are complex data structures that store *keyed collections* of various data and more complex entities (e.g., other objects, methods).

Objects are associative arrays with several special features.

An ampty object can be created using:

1. Object constructor syntax
2. Object literal syntax

```js
let user = new Object();
let user = {};
```

An object can be created with an optional list of properties.

A **property** is a a *key-value* pair where the key is a string (property keys must be strings or symbols - usually strings). The value can be anything, including another object or a function.

Property key is also known as *property name* or *identifier*.

To access a property we may use:

1. Dot notation, or
2. Square bracket notation

To remove property we may use 'delete' operator.

```js
delete user.name;
```

Multi-word property names are OK to use, but must be quoted. We access those with square bracket notation.

The last property in the list may end with a comma that is known as 'trailing' or 'hanging' comma.

Square brackets provide a way to obtain the property name as the result of any expression.

*Computed property*. Square bracket notation gives more flexibility than the 'dot notation'. The key may be calculated at run-time. Square bracket notation is more powerful than dot notation. They allow property names and variables. Dot notation is easier to write and concise.

Special property value shhorthand:

```js
// code
return {
    name: name,
    age: age,
}

// equivalent to
return {
    name,
    age,
}
```

We may mix normal property syntax and shorthand in the same object.

There are no limitations for property names. Language reserved words are allowed as property names (for, return, etc.)

Numbers as property names are converted to strings, as well as Bool, etc. Only strings and symbols allowed.

Additional operators:

- to delete a property: `delete obj.prop`
- to check if a property with the given key exists in the object: `"key" in obj`
- to iterate over object loop `for (let key in obj)`

Allowed to access any property with no errors, even when it doesn't exist. 'undefined' is returned.

*Integer property* is a string that can be converted to/from an integer without a change.

Object properties are ordered in a special fashion. Integer properties are sorted, other appear in the creation order.

Array, Date, Error, etc. are objcets, not the types on their own. They belong to a single object type and extend it in various ways.
