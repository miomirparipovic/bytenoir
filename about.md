This blog is more of a personal journey about my experience in the amazing, yet occasionally frustrating world of programming, and technology. I might throw some thoughts on life in general, just to spice it up and add a bit of intrigue to the mix. However, the main goal is to write about technical subjects with an almost selfish, or self-serving intent aimed at better understanding them. If I'm as a result of that effort able to explain them more clearly to others, I've achieved more than I hoped for. 

A small disclaimer of sorts, if you somehow happen to stumble upon these pages, please accept everything with a grain of salt. Play with the code, test it, and experiment with it. Accept nothing as a given. But that's something you should apply to almost every aspect of your life anyway. Just sayin'.
