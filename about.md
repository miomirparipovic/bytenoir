This blog is more of a personal journey and about my experience with amazing, yet sometimes frustrating world of programming, development and technology. I may throw some thoughts on life in general, just to make things even more interesting. But the main goal is to write about things in a selfish attempt to better understand them. If I'm as a result of that effort able to explain them more clearly to others, I've achieved more than I hoped for. 

A small disclaimer of sort, if you somehow stumble on these pages, please accept everything with a grain of salt. Play with the code, test it, experiment with it. Do not accept anything as a given. But that's something you should apply on almost every aspect of your life anyway. Just sayin'.
