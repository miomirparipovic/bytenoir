This blog is more of a personal journey about my experience in the amazing, yet occasionally frustrating world of programming, development, and technology. I might throw some thoughts on life in general, just to add a bit of intrigue. However, the main goal is to write about subjects with an almost selfish, or self-serving intent aimed at better understanding them. If I'm as a result of that effort able to explain them more clearly to others, I've achieved more than I hoped for. 

A small disclaimer of sort, if you somehow stumble on these pages, please accept everything with a grain of salt. Play with the code, test it, experiment with it. Do not accept anything as a given. But that's something you should apply on almost every aspect of your life anyway. Just sayin'.
